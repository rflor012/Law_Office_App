In today's legal environment, most attorneys and law firms have to create or implement
a variety of payment schemes in order to capture clients that come through the doors.

A recurring theme that my brother, a licensed practicing attorney, and myself, another licensed
practicing attorney, have found is that most clients either do not have the funds to pay a high retainer Fee
or clients are scared away when hearing that their legal representation will cost them a sizable
amount of money up front. In order to accommodate these clients, part of our practice has been to
offer payment plans to clients who voice these concerns.

Thats where LeyPay comes in. (Ley for law in Spanish, and Pay for well....). This application is
my approach to solve a real problem that my brother and I have encountered in our real world
experience. Tracking monthly payments is tedious, takes the time of valuable NECESSARY
employee work(both in tracking and volumes of phone calls requesting information about payments), and often times can be source of contention between the Client and Attorney. (in the case of any discrepancy or payment dispute)

This application is designed to:

1) Create User Accounts for Employees of the Firm. (Authorized and Non-authorized only)
    -A non authorized account WILL NOT AND SHALL NOT access confidential/privileged client information.
2) Allow Employees to create Client Accounts and the Respective Payment Schedules under the supervision of the managing attorney.
3) Allow the Attorney and Authorized Employees access to payment schedules to remind clients of when payments are coming due.
4) Track any Delinquent payments so that those payments do not fall through the cracks
5) Act as an Employee Homepage for computers in the Office. Handy, Often used, links are placed in the nav-bar for employees and attorneys alike to use throughout their workday. 

These main technical functions are in my opinion the best Route to efficient case management/payment management but also lends a major hand to providing effective customer service.
